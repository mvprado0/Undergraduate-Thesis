# Electron Neutrino Disappearance in Fermilab's Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Experiment

Detailed study quantifying the impact of having electron neutrino disappearance on the SBN 3+1 sterile neutrino model sensitivity. Because of the nature of the Booster Neutrino Beam used in the experiment, which is made up of 99.5% muon neutrinos and 0.5% electron neutrinos, the final electron neutrino signal will consist of both oscillated electron neutrinos and intrinsic electron neutrinos. Due to a non-zero oscillation probability for the intrinsic electron neutrinos, however, some of that signal will be lowered, meaning that the sensitivity will be lowered as well. The question is: *by how much will the sensitivity decrease?*

This script calculates and plots the SBN 3+1 sterile neutrino model sensitivity parameter space contours for different values of the intrinsic electron neutrino oscillation probability. This script also plots the electron neutrino event histograms as a function of the reconstructed energy with a comparison between the oscillated and the unoscillated signal.
